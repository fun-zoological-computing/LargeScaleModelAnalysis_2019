# LargeScaleModelAnalysis_2019
Scripts related to analysis of models at the NeuroML Database as presented in 2019 CNS Poster and 20XX paper.

These scripts were written with reproducibility in mind  but not portability. 

## Contents
> 1. <b>/figures</b> contains all scripts used for visualization found in the 2019 poster and 20XX paper
